title: Ungoogled Chromium
type: Worth Mentioning
description: |
  A desktop browser based on Chromium which removes all Google integrations, while adding features which seek to enhance your security, privacy, and control of your browser. However, <mark>we do not strongly recommend the use of Ungoogled Chromium for most users</mark> at this time, because of a lack of official builds and updates from the developer. We strongly believe that auto-updating apps are key for maintaining security, lest you browse the web with outdated builds of your browser which may be susceptible to any number of live exploits.
